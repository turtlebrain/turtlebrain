## 🚀 About Me

Born and raised on the paradisiac island of Mauritius, I’m a developer, technical project manager, and curious mind with a passion for numerical modeling, stochastic analysis, and creative problem-solving. I earned my BASc (2017) and MASc (2019) in Civil Engineering at the University of Waterloo, where my research developed new stochastic frameworks for soil-structure interaction.

My professional journey led me to Rocscience (2020–2025), where I contributed to industry-leading geotechnical software (RSPile, and RocSlope2), and led the development and commercial release of RocSlope2 as project manager. Now, I’m focused on personal projects and riding new waves—literally and figuratively.
